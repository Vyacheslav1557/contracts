# Contracts

[![OpenAPI v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenAPI-v3-green)](https://swagger.io/specification/)

This repository contains OpenAPI schemas for defining API specifications. These schemas provide a structured and
standardized way to describe the API endpoints, data models, and interactions used in the project.

For understanding the architecture, see the [documentation](https://github.com/Vyacheslav1557/docs).

## Overview

The OpenAPI schemas in this repository serve as the contract for the API, ensuring consistency and clarity for
developers, testers, and other stakeholders. They can be used to:

- Generate API documentation
- Validate API requests and responses
- Facilitate client and server code generation
- Support API testing and mocking

## Repository Structure

- `/[service-name]/[version]`: Contains the OpenAPI schema file (e.g., `.yaml` or `.json`).
